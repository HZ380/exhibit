            <p>Welcome to the "Save Detroit Public Transport" exhibition at Old Main. This exhibit serves to make Detroit residents aware of the crumbling state of the city's public transport services.</p>
            <p>Let’s be honest: Detroit’s public transportation system has experienced better times. It resembles that old vehicle parked in your driveway—certainly, it gets you from point A to point B, however, you find yourself holding your breath the whole journey, hoping it doesn't break down. For numerous residents of Detroit, particularly those unable to afford a car (and we recognize that this constitutes a considerable portion of the population), relying on public transit can seem akin to a game of Russian roulette. But what if we proposed that with a touch of thoughtful design and some technological enhancements, we could transform this clunker into a seamless ride? User-centered design is crucial here; after all, who better to refine the service than the individuals who are actually utilizing it? Imagine the integration of advanced technology to enhance route efficiency, or revitalizing infrastructure so that everyone can board without the sensation of dodging potholes! Furthermore, let’s consider safety—because no one wishes to feel as though they are starring in an action film while awaiting their bus.</p>
